Several solutions exist to address this issue. Here are two common approaches:

**1. Avoid `calc()` in Media Queries:**

If possible, try restructuring your CSS to avoid using `calc()` within media queries.  You may be able to achieve the desired layout using different percentage values or units without relying on `calc()` inside the media query.

**2. Use Viewport Units (vw):**

Replace percentage values with viewport units (`vw`). Viewport units are relative to the viewport's width and offer more consistent behavior in responsive layouts. For example, you could express the width as a fraction of the viewport width: 

```css
@media (max-width: 768px) {
  .element {
    width: 50vw - 20px;
  }
}
```

This approach leverages the viewport width directly, avoiding potential misinterpretations of percentages within media query contexts. Choose the solution that best fits your specific layout requirements.  Testing and careful observation across different screen sizes are crucial to ensuring your responsive layout works as intended.
